You need to build a desktop web application for keeping notes. You can draw inspiration from
Google Keep. Here are the features that you need to build:
● User Authentication and content sync
● Menu Features to contain
○ Create a new note
○ Search in your notes
○ Special view - Label View [all tagged notes with that label]
○ Archived Notes
● One note can have multiple tags [up to 9 tags]
● You should be able to toggle between background colors for the note
● Trash Notes - Deleted notes in the last 30 days
Frameworks & Constraints
● Use NodeJS for backend APIs and setup user authentication & user profile.
● We want you to build the frontend application without the use of any frontend
framework.
● You are allowed to use jQuery if you wish.
● For backend, You can use NodeJS or any other JS backend framework.
Bonus Points
● Special View - Reminder [view all notes with an upcoming due date]
● Bonus point for submitting a video demo explaining the functionality of your app
Submission & Allocated Time
It’s a self paced assignment and no restrictions on usage of Google/ ChatGPT but you should
own the code submitted for your final evaluation. Ideally, you should spend 6-8 hours for the
assignment if you have worked in NodeJS (Authentication & CRUD operations) but if it takes
more time, you are free to spend as much time needed to complete the assignment.
